      <h1>The Easy CALCulator</h1>
    <p>The app is simply a calculator made specifically for Calculus. All the Greek symbols they need to use, the derivatives they have to check, the matrices they have to run, etc. All of these processes can be done by hand, with much paper and ink involved, or on your average calculator, although needing a great deal of skipping steps the calculator is capable of. Why is this? Surely if I am capable of doing this math, a computer should be able to as well! And the fact is, they can, they are just bogged down by simple operations many people in higher levels of math don't need. How often do you think a calculus professor needs to add five and fifty-three, or square seven? Hopefully not often!</p>
